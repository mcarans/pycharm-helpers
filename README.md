# pycharm-helpers
Change PyCharm's terminal in settings to "/bin/bash --rcfile PATH_TO_REPO/.pycharmrc" - the PyCharm terminal will open in your virtualenv.

Make external tools for sphinx-apidoc.sh and coverage.sh. You can use the icon to add a new tool in the toolbar for test coverage (assuming you run py.test!).

For sphinx-apidoc, you can add it to the standard documentation generation configuration in PyCharm - not sure why this part of api generation is missing in the first place in PyCharm.
